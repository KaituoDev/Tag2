# GameTemplate
Here's a simple template for minigames.
There are a few steps before you start programming:
- configure the plugin.yml
- refactor the classes' name to ###GAME_NAME###.java and ###GAME_NAME###Game.java
- refactor the package (optional)
- ~~configue the auto deploy process (optional, at .github/workflow/main.yml)~~ The template now contains a workflow which should not need any change.
